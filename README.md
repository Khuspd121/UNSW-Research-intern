### Project Overview

This project focuses on designing a reflective spiral staircase for generating orbital angular momentum (OAM) vortex beams. Conducted under the supervision of Prof. Andrey Miroshnichenko at the School of Engineering and Information Technology, UNSW Canberra, the research explores traditional and high-resolution approaches (HRAs) for vortex beam generation. The desired profile with a topological charge of \( l = 1 \) was formulated using cylindrically symmetric Laguerre-Gaussian beam solutions. Key methodologies include modifying the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for reflection, adjusting Fresnel propagation for oblique incidence, and employing optimization techniques like gradient descent and the Adam optimizer to enhance the phase profile and intensity of the generated beams.
